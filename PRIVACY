Nutrika (the nutrient calculator and analyzer software) is intended to do 
generic calculation regarding diet, recommendended intakes, and price/value 
ratios. It gathers and saves data only to help calculations by organizing 
information (food amount and price) for people of choosen life stage group, 
age, and weight. The user's data is stored in the SQLite database file: 
"/mnt/sdcard/nutrika/user.db". You may delete this file if you do not need or 
want it any more. It will be recreated empty next time you start Nutrika.

Nutrika does not disclose data using network connections. However, anyone or 
anything with access to the device can retrieve the data stored in the 
memory of the device.

Nutrika is not designed for any other purpose than the one above, and it is 
not recommended to use it any other way like storing sensitive personal or 
business information.
